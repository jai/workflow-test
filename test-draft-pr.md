# Test Draft PR Feature

This file is created to test the draft PR to ready for review workflow trigger.

## Purpose
- Validate that marking a draft PR as "ready for review" triggers our code review workflow
- Ensure the workflow handles the `ready_for_review` event properly

## Test Scenarios
1. Create draft PR
2. Mark as ready for review
3. Observe workflow execution
